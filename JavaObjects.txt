Literal Notation:

It's a variable assigned a value of an object inside the curly braces, { }.
Every property of a JavaScript object consists of a key-value pair. The key is the variable that describes the kind of information to be stored. The value is the specific value of the key
Each key-value pair is separated by a colon: And pairs are separated from each other with a comma,

When this is used in an object's method, it always refers to the object on which the method is called.


Constructors:

A constructor is a function that can be invoked using the new keyword to create new objects
 To visually identify constructor functions, they are conventionally named with a capital first letter.

1: Declare a function: function People(name, languages, age) {
                           this.name = name;
                           this.languages = languages;
                           this.age = age;
                           }
2: Then Declare your variables that represent the People:
    like: var isack = new People("Isack", ["English", "Swahili", "Zulu"], 20); and so on with as many vars as you want!

Prototypes:

To define methods, JavaScript employs prototypes.
A prototype is just an object from which other objects inherit methods. 
avaScript first looks at the methods on the object, and if it doesn't find them there, it looks to the prototype.
People.prototype.greetings = function() {
                console.log("Whatsup?!");
                }
This prototype method can be shared by all the objects in the var people or any other objects. eg Isack.greetings();

ADDRESS BOOK:
SCRIPTS:

1: Business logic: Create your constructor function:
2: User interface logic: $(document).ready(function(event) {
                                  $("form id").submit(function()
                                       
3: Create varibles for what you want to have in your ADB: var inputtedfirstName = $("input id for first name").val(); and so on.

4: Create  a var for the new things/items: var newPeople = new People(inputtedFirstName, inputtedLastName);

5: Append your list:    $("ul id").append("<li><span class='people'>" + newPeople.firstName + "</span></li>");

6: List what you wanted in your ADB:  $("input id").val("");
                                      $("input id").val("");

7: Close the functions
