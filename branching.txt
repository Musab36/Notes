Branching:

In order for for GitHub Pages to work, we need to create a branch called gh-pages.We can also have several other copies of our project on the same machine in the same directory with different names. Each version or copy of the master is called a branch. A branch can split off from the master the same way a tree branch splits off from the trunk of the tree.

First we will create the new branch and switch into it by running the commands:

$ git branch gh-pages 
$ git checkout gh-pages

Pushing branches to GitHub:

Now that we are in the gh-pages branch, let's push this new branch to GitHub:

$ git push origin gh-pages 

Merging:

create a branch,git branch (branch name)
checkout (branch name)
git add --all
git commit -m "branch name"
git push origin (branch name)
to merge git checkout to the branch you want to merge the changes into
then git merge (the branch name you want to merge changes from
To delete the old branch git -D (branch name)
