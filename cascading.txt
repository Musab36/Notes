understanding cascading: 

If two rules have the same specificity, the last one wins - in other words, the one that's the farthest down in the CSS file takes precedence.

 In the Cascading section, we learned:

Styles can be inherited by elements nested within other elements
In the CSS stylesheet, body can be used to style the entire page
Elements within other elements are known as child elements
The more specific CSS rule takes precedence
Avoid inline styling at all costs because it invalidates the power of CSS
