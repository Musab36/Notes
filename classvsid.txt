class vs id:

Both id's and classes can be targeted by CSS rules (classes with a . and id's with a # symbol). For example, both paragraph tags below are styled the same, though one is referenced by class and the other by id.

The important difference is that id's are unique, while classes are not unique. We can use the same class on multiple elements, while id's must be unique to a single element on the page. Id's may appear to work even when duplicated on the same page, but duplicate id's will lead to inconsistent behavior and difficult-to-find bugs. 
If in doubt, use a class.
