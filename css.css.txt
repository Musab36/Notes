CSS = Cascading Style Sheets.They're called cascading because often a single element on a webpage will have multiple sources that style it, and CSS resolves those differences to create the style you see on the screen.

CSS rule. The h1 part is called a selector, because it selects the HTML elements that the rule applies to. The color is called a property, and then blue is called a value.Once again, notice the indentation: the property and value are indented two spaces, because they are inside the selector.
Let's add some more rules:


Note that the link below says css/styles.css because in relation to this favorite-things.html file, the styles.css file is in a subdirectory named css. If the styles.css file were in the same directory as the favorite-things.html file, then the link would just be to "styles.css" rather than to "css/styles.css".

px is short for pixels, which are a unit of measurement. Sans Serif is a kind of font. Named colors, like the blue we used for our h1, aren't used very commonly. Instead, it's more typical to use a three- or six-digit hexadecimal code like this:

<head>
  <link href="CSS/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
ul {
  font-size: 20px;
  line-height: 30px;
  color: purple;
}
h2 {
  font-style: italic;
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
}
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: orange;
}

h1{
color: #00f;
}

or like this:

h1{
color: #0000ff;
}
Both of these are equivalent to the named color blue. If you use a graphics program
 it usually can tell you the hex code for the colors you're using. There are also a lot of online tools for picking colors and getting their hex codes.
Finally, you might be wondering why we made our <h2>s italic in CSS instead of just adding the <em>. The reason is two-fold. First, we can modify the <em> tag just like any other HTML tag. Remember, <em> stands for emphasize, and at some point, we might decide that things that need emphasis should be bolded in addition to being italicized, which we might not want for our <h2>s. Second, one of the great advantages of CSS is that it makes it easy to change styles in many places at once. Let's say we use an <em> tag inside our <h2>s to make them italic. If we later change our mind and want them to be bold, we have to remove all of the <em> tags and replace them with <strong> tags. By using CSS instead, we only have to change the one CSS rule, and every single <h2> on every single web page that uses this CSS file will be updated. 
My apologies for the long lecture, but this last point is really important. Building web sites is fundamentally different from building physical things. When you finish building a bridge, you're more or less done: there's not much you can change besides a coat of paint. But when you finish building a website, you've only just begun. There will be additions, deletions, changes, redesigns, and a whole lot more. CSS gives us some powerful tools to make it easier to change what we've built. If you remember nothing else, remember this: good code is code that is easy to change.
To see the beauty of using CSS, check out CSS Zen Garden. On the right side of the page, clicking one of the links will apply a different stylesheet to the same HTML. The page is totally transformed - no changes to the HTML needed. Your goal in writing CSS should be to allow to Zen Garden-style changes to your styles. If you're following along and your CSS file isn't actually adding styles to your web page, see the next lesson, which introduces debugging.
