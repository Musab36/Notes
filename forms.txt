:For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the word required within your input element, you would use: <input type="text" required>

:You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer.

Radio buttons are a type of input

Each of your radio buttons should be nested within its own label element.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a radio button:

<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>

:Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.

Checkboxes are a type of input

Each of your checkboxes should be nested within its own label element.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a checkbox:

<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>

:You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example:

<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>
