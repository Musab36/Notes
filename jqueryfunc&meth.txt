Jquery functions/methods:
.toggle(); Shows and hides everytime you click the button
.fadeIn() method is used to fade in a hidden element.
.fadeOut() method is used to fade out a visible element.

$(document).ready(function() {
    $("button").addClass("animated bounce"); = Adds animated bounce effect
    $(".text-primary").addClass("animated shake"); = Adds animated shake effect
    $(".well").addClass("animated shake");
    $("#target6").addClass("animated fadeOut"); = Adds animated fadeOut effect
    $("body").addClass("animated hinge");
  });

addClass() function = adds classes using jquery

In the same way you can add classes to an element with jQuery's addClass() function, you can remove them with jQuery's removeClass() function.

Here's how you would do this for a specific button:

$("#target2").removeClass("btn-default");

We can also change the CSS of an HTML element directly with jQuery.

jQuery has a function called .css() that allows you to change the CSS of an element.
$("#target1").css("color", "blue");

You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. For example, you can disable buttons.

When you disable a button, it will become grayed-out and can no longer be clicked.

jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.

Here's how you would disable all buttons:

$("button").prop("disabled", true);

Using jQuery, you can change the text between the start and end tags of an element. You can even change HTML markup.

jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.

Here's how you would rewrite and emphasize the text of our heading:

$("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");

jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags. In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with.

jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely

jQuery has a function called appendTo() that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.

jQuery has a function called clone() that makes a copy of an element.
$("#target2").clone().appendTo("#right-well");
Did you notice this involves sticking two jQuery functions together? This is called function chaining and it's a convenient way to get things done with jQuery.

jQuery has a function called parent() that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected.
$("#left-well").parent().css("background-color", "blue")

jQuery has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.

Here's an example of how you would use the children() function to give the children of your left-well element the color of blue:

$("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue")

jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. target:nth-child(n) css selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.

Here's how you would give the third element in each well the bounce class:

$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");

You can also target all the even-numbered elements.

Here's how you would target all the odd-numbered elements with class target and give them classes:

$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");
