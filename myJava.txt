                                JAVA
        VARIABLES:
You can never use an number in the begginning of var like int 10my_number, you can use a number in the middle or at the end.
Var names can't contain spaces
public class MyFirstclass {

public static void main(String[] args) { 
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
                // This is our scope and main method

int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 7;
int result = number1 + number2;
System.out.println(result);


	}


}

# Everything must be in a class like the public class we have at the top
# If we devide number1 and number2 we will get 0,to avoid that use float in the place of int like:

float number1 = 5;
float number2 = 7;
float result = number1 / number2;
System.out.println(result);

        TYPES OF VARIABLES
There are two types of variables:
1: Primitive types: Such as:
                      a: int
                      b: float = float  my_float = 2.5f; If you don't put f at the end, it will become a double.
                      c: long = long my_long = 1000;
                      d: short = short my_short = 100;
                      e: byte = byte my_byte = 10;
                      f: double = for decimals and its container takes 8 bytes: double  my_double = 25.2;
# float and int can hold only 4 bytes.
2: Complex types: such as:
                      a: string = String my_string = "bla bla"; String is a class and classes start with a capital.
                      b: char = char my_char = 'c'; char is a character and uses single quotes.
                      c: Scanner = it's a class, String name, int age; Scanner my_scanner = new Scanner(System.in); 
                                   you'll need to import the  scanner for  it to work, System.in takes input from the user
                                   System.ou.println("Please enter your name");
                                   name = my_scanner.next(); .next is a scanner method, if you put .nextLine();
                                   instead of .next() it will take the entire line as one and will allow
                                   the user to put his full name
                                   System.out.println("Please enter your age");
                                   age = my_scanner.nextInt(); Int specifies intergers
                                   System.out.println("name: " + name);
                                   System.out.println("age: " + age);

                                                  ARRAYS:
int[] my_array = new int[5] {10, 12, 16, 20, 30};
To access your values you can do: System.out.println(my_array[3]);
int = type of what should be in the array
{10, 12, 16, 20, 30}; = this is our array
[] = the array, you can also put it after the name like my_array[]
my_array = the array name
new = we use new for adding items into the array
[5] = the number of things in the array

int[] big_array = new int[1000];
for(int i = 0; i < big_array.length; i++) {
big_array[i] = i;
}

#This is an array of intergers and arrays only hold one data type
