Pig Latin:

Rules:
1:For words beginning with a vowel, add "ay" to the end.
2:For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay"
3:If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
4:For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
